"""
FlowCal Python API example, using calibration beads data.

This script is divided in three parts. Part one loads and processes
calibration beads data from an FCS file in order to obtain a transformation
function that can later be used to convert cell fluorescence to units of
Molecules of Equivalent Fluorophore (MEF). At several points in this
process, plots are generated that give insight into the relevant steps.

Part two processes data from five cell samples, and uses the MEF
transformation function from part one to convert fluorescence of these
samples to MEF. Plots are also generated in this stage.

Part three exemplifies how to use the processed cell sample data with
FlowCal's plotting and statistics modules, in order to produce interesting
plots.

For details about the experiment, samples, and instrument used, please
consult readme.txt.
